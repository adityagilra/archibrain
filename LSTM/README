Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

The codes are organized in the following way:

- LSTM_SAS.py is the main file that runs simulations and analysis of LSTM on the SAS task (constrution of the dataset comes from task_saccades.py)

- LSTM_12AX.py is the main file that runs simulations and analysis of LSTM on the 12AX task (constrution of the dataset comes from task_1_2AX.py)

- LSTM_tasks.py is used externally for the interface.py in the main folder

- LSTM_model.py implements the LSTM network and dynamics in keras both for the training and the test (disjoint functions for SAS and 12AX tasks)

- LSTM_model_2.py (old) is an alternative way of running LSTM simulations with training and test functions shared by all the tasks
