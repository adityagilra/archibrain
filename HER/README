Hierarchical Error Representation model (HER) - "Frontal cortex function derives from hierarchical predictive coding", W. Alexander, J. Brown. 


The codes are organized in the following way:

- HER_main.py (old) is the file where the HER architecture is built, the parameters are set and the task is decided
  The task is selected by the user during compilation time: after the program is run using python3 HER_main.py, the user has to select a task as requested.
	1: 1-2 task
	2: AX CPT task
	3: 12-AX task
	4: titanic task 
  Enter the id of the task and then push enter to perform it.

- HER_model.py implements all the dynamics of the multi-level system both for the training and the test (disjoint functions for SAS and 12AX tasks)
  Here is the operations it presents in order of execution:
	1. initialization of the variables
	2. presentation of the current stimulus
	3. gating memory for each level
	4. computation of prediction, top-down and modulated prediction (starting from the superior level and proceeding downwards)
	5. computation of the error and of the modulated error
	6. bottom-up
	7. update weights.
	8. update of the eligibility trace
  N.B. Memory states are reset at the end of each trial!

- HER_level.py implements the class for each level of the HER architecture. 
  The key functions are:
	-- gating-memory(s), 
	-- compute_error(p,o),
	-- bottom_up(e) 
	-- top_dow(p_err)

- HER_base.py inherits from HER_level to create the object for the bottom level. 
  In addition to the general HER_level, HER_base presents also the dynamics for the response selection in compute_response(p). 
  The function compute_error(p,o,resp_ind) takes the additional response index parameter to create the activity filter a. 
  The class has also the functions base_training and base_test which can be used in case the HER architecture has only one level (and there is no modulation).

- activations.py presents just some general activation functions to use in the network.

- HER_SAS.py is the main file that runs simulations and analysis of HER on the SAS task (constrution of the dataset comes from task_saccades.py)

- HER_12AX.py is the main file that runs simulations and analysis of HER on the 12AX task (constrution of the dataset comes from task_12AX.py)

- HER_tasks.py is used externally for the interface.py in the main folder
