Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC)

The folders are organized in the following way:

- ORIGINAL DNC includes the implementation of the DNC model in tensorflow as contained in https://github.com/deepmind/dnc. In addition it contains the tasks for SAS, 12AX and omniglot and related results. 

- MODIFIED DNC has the development of DNC and the data from the simulations on the omniglot task. Developments of DNC model involve simplification of the addressing scheme to pure content-based strategy (Reduced DNC), optional flag for LRUA access module to memory specifically for classification tasks and optional flag for structuration of the input (concatenated or not)

- One-Shot-NTM contains the implementation of NTM model with LRUA scheme according to the model described by A. Santoro in "One-shot Learning with Memory-Augmented Neural Networks". 

- plotting, which has all the images and scripts associated to the comparison of the performance of MANNs on the omniglot task
